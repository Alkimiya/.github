Alkimiya is a blockspace markets protocol that facilitates the creation, trading, and settlement of synthetic blockspace resources via a peer-to-peer system of smart contracts.

Public blockchains face inherent limitations in transaction capacity, leading to competition for inclusion via fees. While blockspace supply remains constant, demand fluctuates due to various external factors. Alkimiya tackles this issue by abstracting key blockspace resources, such as average transaction fees, into tradable assets. This approach enables more accurate price discovery and efficient resource allocation for all users, from large organizations to individual participants.
